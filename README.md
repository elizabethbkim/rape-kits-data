State-by-state rape kit backlog data, 2018-2022

## overview

Every year, thousands of people in the US are victims of sexual assault, yet only a fraction of these cases ever make it to court. One major obstacle to justice is the rape kit backlog: the overwhelming number of untested rape kits sitting in hospitals, labs, and police departments across the country.

No one really knows how many backlogged rape kits there are nationally. One 2018 National Institute of Justice funded study estimated that there were around 200,000 in the custody of police departments alone (not counting the number of untested kits in crime labs). Part of the problem is that rape kit backlog data by state is widely inaccessible, barred by outdated law enforcement data management systems and the absence of state laws mandating data collection.

This is why I filed 58 public records requests in December of 2022, asking each state, DC, and some cities for their rape kit backlog data. I ended up receiving rape kit backlog data (2018-2022) from around 30 states. This data is broken down by backlogged kits in the possession of crime labs and law enforcement agencies. and it forms the basis of the investigative piece [How many rape kits are awaiting testing in the US? ](https://usafacts.org/articles/how-many-rape-kits-are-awaiting-testing-in-the-us-see-the-data-by-state/), published at USAFacts in May 2023. 

## usage

Use this dataset to track the rape kit backlog in your state. This dataset has the unique benefit of collecting rape kit backlog data from 2018 onwards, so you can see how the rape kit backlog in your state has fluctuated over time. (It may become evident to you that the rape kit backlog is rarely completely eliminated.) 

Other uses for this dataset: familiarzing yourself with the sources for rape kit backlog data, or identifying the appropriate public official to contact for conducting your own investigation into the matter. 

## documentation

**_all backlog data_** is the master spreadsheet with all of the backlog data I collected, through FOIAs, public reports, or both. **_crime lab backlog data footnotes_** details the caveats or calculation methods for the crime lab data, while **_law enforcement backlog data footnotes_** does the same for the law enforcement data. 

The folder _**state by state data**_ contains individual data from each state. In response to my records requests, most states provided me with the aggregated rape kit backlog statistics I requested, either directly or by referring me to public reports. In those cases, both the state's PDF response and/or links to the public reports are included. Twelve states/cities, however, sent me kit-level data that required extensive data cleaning: Mesa, Arizona; Tucson, Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana; Kentucky; Maryland; Michigan; Olive Branch, Mississippi; North Carolina; Oregon; Virginia; Washington; and West Virginia. For these particular states and cities, you will find the original spreadsheet or PDF that was sent to me, usually containing records of all kits received from 2018 onwards. Whenever I needed clarification on the data and followed up with an official, I have included a PDF of the exchange as well.

## acknowledgments

[End the Backlog](https://www.endthebacklog.org/) was the first to map the rape kit backlog nationally, and its data proved invaluable during this project. 

A massive thank you as well to Matt Dempsey, Helaman Sanchez, Sasha Anderson, and about a dozen volunteers who helped me file FOIAs in the states with restrictive public records laws.
